In the traditional assurance engagement the roles of the three assurance parties are separated, and this works effectively where there is the right alignment between parties. The responsible party (first party) must be sufficiently motivated to provide full and true information to the assurance provider (third party) (e.g. deterrent, or independent checking). The assurance user (second party) and assurance provider (third party) need to be aligned on the right criteria to establish whether the subject matter presented by the responsible party (first party) is in fact trustworthy.

## In some assurance engagements roles can be combined

The first and second parties can be combined: For example, if an executive deploying an AI system wants external verification or peer review of their own performance. In this case the executive is both the responsible party and the assurance user. This isn’t problematic from an incentive basis, but does impose additional verification costs which may disincentivise this type of assurance if it is not a regulatory requirement.

The second and third parties in an assurance relationship can be combined: In cases where executive procuring a system carries out due diligence, the assurance user gathers their own evidence from the first party and carries out their own assessment, also taking on the role of assurance provider.

The first and third parties in an assurance relationship can be combined: For example, If a responsible party self-assesses their compliance and communicates this to an assurance user. This assurance relationship works where there are agreed, objective standards and gaming-proof ways of testing. Without objective, agreed standards, self-assessment risks deception or providing assurance second party wouldn’t agree with, making it useless in conveying trustworthiness.

## Tradeoffs between different types of assurance relationships

There are pros, cons and different preconditions for using different assurance models that result in tradeoffs which need to be considered. In this section we highlight the trade-offs for assurance between cost / efficiency / independence / accountability / expertise / information, which make 1st party, 2nd party and 3rd party assurance more or less appropriate.

## 1st party assurance: self-assessment by the responsible party

First party assurance can enable more efficient assurance and save on costs for the responsible party. Also, self-assessment can be preferable where expert or subjective judgement is needed to assure the system. First party self-assessment can leverage the judgement of the developer who has access to the most information about the system and is responsible for its trustworthy development.

However, a lack of independence or independent oversight in this process may mean that this form of assurance is less trusted and less trustworthy. Agreed standards are needed to allow first parties (developers) to declare conformance in a trusted/trustworthy manner.

## 2nd party assurance: due diligence by the assurance user

2nd party assurance is performed by the assurance user, who might assess documentation about system performance or quality management practices, or assess or perform risk assessments. In many organisations second party assurance (due diligence) is performed by a specialist internal team.

Second party assurance can lower costs by avoiding the need for independent assurance providers. However, as with first party assurance, second party assurance may not increase trust further down the supply chain and throughout the ecosystem. Frontline users, affected parties and sector regulators may be cautious of the trustworthiness of this assurance due to the conflicting interests of the assurance provider who wants to use the system.

## 3rd party assurance: independent assessment or verification

External third party assurance can be performed either through an attestation by a first party which is then verified by a third party, or by the direct determination of a third party based upon their own evaluation of the subject matter.

Third party assurance increases trustworthiness in the assurance process due to its independence from the incentives of responsible parties and assurance users. However, third party assurance is the most costly, can be less efficient than first and second party assurance and is not always most effective. In certain circumstances the first party will be better placed to provide assurance, where they have the expertise and/or responsibility to make informed subjective judgements.
